Where a taxpayer purchases an insurance policy which, in ac-
cordance with its terms, would reimburse the taxpayer, to the ex-
tent specified in ihe policy, for certain business overhead expenses
ineurred by him during prolonged periads of disability due to injury
or sickness, any proceeds derived under the terms of such policy
constitute and are inctudible in gross income under the provisious
of section 61 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 or section 24(a}
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, Auy premiums paitt on such
policy constitute business expenses aud are deductible from gross
income under the provisions of section 162 of the 1954 Code or
section 23(a) of ibe 1934 Code.

Advice has been requested whether any proceeds derived from a
professional overhead expense disability policy, which policy is for
the purpose of reimbursing the holders thereof for business overhead
expenses incurred by them during prolonged periods of disability dua
to injury or sickness, is excludable from gross income. Advice has
also ‘been requested whether the insurance premiums paid would
be nondeductible from gross income as an expenditure attributable to

tax exempt income.

Taxpayer purchased an insurance policy under the terms of which
he would be reimbursed for overhead expenses incurred by him with
respect to his occupation during Prolonged periods of disability. The
policy provides that if certain specified injuries or sickness, directly
and independently of all other classes, shall wholly and continuously
disable the insured and prevent him from performing any and every
duty pertaining to his occupation for a period of more than # days,
the company will pay certain specified monthly expenses actually in-
curred by the insured up to’an amount not exceeding the limitation
specified in the policy for the period of such continuous disability, not
exceeding a period of 3¢ months, . . .

The policy furtber provides that no indemnity shall he paid for the
first # days of any period of disability unless such disability continues
for more than said # days, nor for any period of disability prior to the
first date of medical treatment by a licensed physician or surgeon,
other than the insured. The expense benefits payable under the policy
shall be the monthly expenses actually incurred by the insured in the
operation of his office or, in the event of joint occupancy, the insured’s
portion of such expenses and shall be limited in the manner set forth
in the policy. Such expenses shall include rent, clectricity, heat,
water, laundry, depreciation, employees’ salaries and such other fixed
expenses as are normal and customary in the conduct and operation of
the insured’s office but shall not include salary, fees, drawing account
or any other remuneration for the insured or any other member of the
insured’s profession hired by or working with the insured, or the cost
of pharmaceutical products,

The actual questions presented are whether any insurance proceeds
received by the taxpayer, in accordance with the terms of the above
policy, are excludable from his gross income and whether the insurance
promiuans paid would be nondeductible under section 24(a) (5) of the

nternal Revenue Code of 1930 as an expenditure attributable to tax
exempt income.

Gross income as defined under section 22(a) of ihe Internal Revenue
Code of 1939 and section 61 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954,
means all income from whatever source derived, unless exempt from
tax by law. In general, income is the gain derived from capital, from
Jabor, or both combined.

Tnsurance policies issued to provide reimbursement for overhead
expenses in cases of prolonged disability of the insured do not come
within the purview of compensation for personal sickness or injury.
Such insurance policies are issued strictly for business purposes and
in no way compensate the insured for injuries or sickness within the
meaning of section 22(b) (5) of the 1989 Code. ‘The proceeds of such
policies are in the nature of the procceds of a “Use and Occupancy
Contract,” which insures against actual loss sustained of net profits,
and the proceeds of which sre income in the same manner that the
profits for which ie are substituted would have been. See section
39.112(f)-1(c) (8) of Regulations 118:

Section 23(a) of the 1939 Code and section 162 of the 1954 Code
provide that there shall be allowed as a deduction all the ordinary and
necessary expenses paid or incurred during a taxible year in carrying
on any trade or business. Section 39.23(a)} (1) of Regulations 118, in

13 [8 72.

enumerating deductible expenses, includes premiums against fire,
storm, theft, accident, or other similar losses in the case of a trade or
business.

Accordingly, it is held that where a taxpayer purchases an insur-
ance policy which, in accordance with its terms, would reimburse the
taxpayer, to the extent specified in the policy, for certain business
overhead expenses incurred by him during prolonged periods of dis-
ability due to injury or sickness, any proceeds derived under the terms
of such policy constitute and are includible in gross income under the

vrovisions of section 61 of the 1954 Code or section 223(a) of the 1939
code, Any premiums paid on such policy constitute business
expenses and are deductible from gross income under the provisions
of section 162 of the 1954 Code or section 23(a) of the 1939 Code.

SECTION 61.—GROSS INCOME DEFINED
Rev. Rul. 55-357

The insurance available to Government employees under the Fed-
eral Employees’ Group Life Insurance Act of 1954, 68 Stat. 736, 5
UL S. C. 2091, is of the “group term” type. It has no cash surrender
or Joan value at any time, The Internal Revenue Service has previ-
ously held that premiums or portions of premiums paid by employers
for insurance of this type on the lives of their employees are not income
to such employees, See Law Opinion 1014, C. J3, 8, 88 (1920) ; Rev.
Rul. §4-165, C. B, 1934-1,17. Accordingly, a Government employee
isnot required to include in his income that portion of the premiums on
his Federal Employees’ Group Life Insurance which is paid by the
Government. However, the portion of the insurance premium paid
by the employee by withholding from his salary is includible in his
income and tax is withheld on this amount, as provided by section 8402
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, in the same manner as in the
case of civil service retirement deductions.

SECTION 102—GIFTS AND INHERITANCES

{Also Part IT, Section 22(b) ; Regulations Rev. Rul. 55-422

The Internal Revenue Service will follow the decislon in Chartes
Schall ef ua. v. Commissioner, 174 Fed. (2d) 893, and other cited
decisions, in deciding in other cases whether payments to retired
ministers or rabbis under similar circumstances represent taxable
compensation for past services or gifts excludable from gross income
under seetion 102 of the 1954 Code.

Advice has been requested whether the Internal Revenue Service
will continue to litigate issues similar to those involved in Charles
Schall et ua. v. Commissioner, 114 Fed. (2d) 898; Andrew Mutch v.
Commissioner, 209 Fed. (2d) 890; Kavanagh y. Abraham MM. Hersh-
man et al. 210 Fed. (2) 654; and William 8S, Abernethy et al. v. Com-
méssioner, 211 Fed. (2d) 651, all involving the question whether pay-
ments on an annual or monthly basis to a retired minister or rabbi, au-
thorized for an indefinite period by his congregation at or about the
time of his retirement, were taxable as additional compensation for
past services or constituted gifts exempt under section 22(b) (8) of the
19389 Code, The same problem arises under section 102 of the 1954

sode, which excludes gifts from gross income,

An the cited cases the payments were not made in accordance with
any enforceable agreement, established plan, or past practice; the
recipient did not undertake to perform any further services for
the congregation and was not expected to do so; there was a far closer
personal relationship between the recipient and the congregation
than is found in lay employment relationships; and the available
evidence indicated that the amount paid was determined in the light
of the financial position of the congregation and the needs of the
recipient, who had been udequately compensated for his past services.

The decisions in the cited cases, to the effect that the amounts
involved were exempt gifts rather than taxable income, are accepted
by the Service on their particular facts. In other cases involving
payments to retired ministers or rabbis under similar circumstances
the amounts paid will accordingly be treated as gifts excludable
from gross income under section 102 of the 1954 Code.

SECTION 105 —AMOUNTS RECEIVED UNDER ACCIDENT
AND HEALTIT PLANS

Rev. Rul. 55-85

The wages received by a civilian employee of the United States
Government for a period during which he is absent from work on
account of personal injuries or sickness are excludable from hig
gress income to the extent provided in section 105 (d) of the In-
ternal Revenue Code of 1454. If the absence is, in fact, due to per-
sonal injury or illness, the manner in which the absence is reflected
in the records of the employing agency will not be deLerminative of
the right of the employee tu the benefit of the cxelusion under such
section,

Advice has been requested whether the provisions of section 105 (d)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 are applicable to the compensa-
tion received by a civilian employee of the United States Government
for a period during which the employee is absent from work on ac-
count of personal injuries or sickness.

Section 105 of the 1954 Code, relating to amounts received under
accident and health plans, provides in part as follows:

(a) AMoUNTS ATTRIBUTABLE To Exproyver ConTrtevT10Ns.—Except as other-
Wise provided in this scclion, amounts received by an employee through accident
or healih insurance for personal injuries or sicksess shall be included in gross
income to the extent such amounts (1) are attributatle to contributions by the
employer which were not includible in the gross income of the employee, or (2)
are paid by the employer.

* * * * * * ‘

(d) Wace Conrinvation PLAans.—Gross income does not include amounts re-
ferred to in subsection (a) if such amounts constitute wages or payments in
lieu of wages for a period during which the employee is absent from work on
account of personal injuries or sickness; but this subsection shall not apply to
the extent that such amounts exceed a weekly rate of $100, In the case of a
period during yhich the employee is absent from work on account of sickness,
the preceding sentence shull not apply to amounts attributable to the first 7
calendar days in such period unless ihe employee is hospitalized on account of
sickuess for at least one day during such period. If such amounts are not paid
on the basis of a weekly pay period, the Secretary or his delegate shall by regu-
lations prescribe the method of determining the weekly rate at which such
amounts are paid.

Amounts received under an accident or health plan for employees
are to be treated as amounts received through accident or health
insurance for the purpose of section 105 of the Code and the provi-
sions of such section are applicable with respect to taxable years
beginning after December 31, 1953, and ending after August 16, 1954.
Thus, in the case of a calendar-year taxpayer such provisions would
apply to amounts received on and after January 1, 1954,

employees of the United States Government for periods of absence

plans within the meaning of section 105 of the Code. Consequently,
the wages received by such an employee for a period during which
he is absent from work on account of personal injuries or sickness are
exeludable from his gross income to the extent provided in section
105 (d) of the Code. If the absence is, in fact, due to upersenal injury
or illness, the manner in which the absence is reflected in the records
of the employing agency will not be determinative of the right of the
employee to the benefit of the exclusion under such section.

Rev. Rul. 55-245

To the extent of a weekly rate of $100, wages or payments in lien
of wages received by an officer or enlisted man as a member of the
Armed Forces for a period during which he is confined as a patient
in a hospital on account of personal injuries or sickness are excludable
from gross income under section 105(d) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1954, even though such member may be convalescing and
doing light work in the operation of the hospital to which he is
confined,

Rev. Rul. 55-263

The term “sickness” as used in section 105{d) of the Internal
Revenue Cade of 1954 does not include the condition of preguancy.
However, an employee who is absent from work on account of sick-
ness during a period of pregnancy may, to the extent provided in
section 105(d), exclude from her gross income amounts received for
the period of absence, even though the sickness is caused by her
pregnu ney,

Advice has been requested whether the provisions of section 105(d)
of the Internal Revere Code of 1954 are applicable to the compen-
sation received under an accident and health plan by an employee
who is absent from work during pregnancy.

Section 103 of the 1954 Code, relating to amounts received under
accident and health plans, provides in part as follows:

(a) AMOUNTS ATTRIBUTARLE TO EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS.~-Except as other-
wise provided in this section, amounts received by an employee through accident
or health insurance for personal injuries or sickness shall be included in gross
Income to the extent such amounts (1) are attributable te contributions by the

(d) Waar Continuation Pians.—Gross income does not include amounts
referred to in subsection (a) if such amounts constitute wages or payments in
lieu of wages for a period during which the employee is absent from work on
account of personal injuries or sickness; but this subsection shall not apply to
the extent that such amounts exceed a weekly rate of $100, In the case of a
period during which the employee is absent from work on account of sickness,
the preceding sentence shall not apply to amounts attributable to the first 7
calendar days in such period unless the employee is hospitalized on account of
sickness for at least one day during such period. If such amounts are not
paid on the basis of a weekly pay period, the Secretary or his delegate shall
by regulations prescribe the method of determining the weekly rate at which
such amounts are paid,

Amounts received under an accident or health plan for employees
are to be treated as amounts received through accident or health in-

of such section are applicable with respect to taxable years beginning
aiter December 31, 1953, and ending after Angust 16,1934, Thus, in
the case of a calendar-year taxpayer, such provisions would apply to
amounts received on and after January 1, 1954,

Rev, Rul. 55-283

Wages or payments in lien of wages received by an employee for a
period during which the employee is absent from work because he is
under quarantine imposed by legal authority by reason of the illness
of a member of his family, or because a member of his immediate fam-
ily is afllicted with a contagious disease or is otherwise sick or phys-
ically incapacitated and requires the care and attendance of the em-
ployee, are not amounts received “for a period during which the em-
ployee is absent from work on account of personal injuries or sick-
ness” within the meaning of section 105(d) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1954 even though, pursuant to an accident or health plan, the
absence is charged to the employee’s sick leave. Such amounts ure
not excludable from the employee's gross income under such section.

Rev. Rul. 55-366

Anemployee received wages or payments under a wage continuation
plan for the period September 17, 1953, through February 1, 1954,
during which he was absent from work on account of sickness. In
October 1953 he was hospitalized, but. none of the period of absence
jn 1954 was spent inthe hospilal. eld, the requirement with respect
1o the 7-day waiting period provided in section 105(d) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1954 is met at the end of the seventh day of absence
on account of sickness even though the seventh day occurs prior to
January 1, 1954. Similarly, the alternative requirement of hospital-
ization is met when the employee is hospitalized on account of sickness
for 1 day during the period of absence, even though it is in the portion
of the period of absence which occurs in 1953. Only wages or pay-
ments in lien of wages received after December 31, 1953, however, are
excludable under section 105 (a).

PART V.—DEDUCTIONS FOR PERSONAL EXEMPTIONS

SECTION 151—ALLOWANCE OF DEDUCTIONS
FOR PERSONAL EXEMPTIONS

{Also Part I, Section 25; Regulations 118, Rev. Rul.55-325
Section 39.95-2.)

A spouse cannot qualify as a dependent under section 151 of the
1954 Code and an exemption is not allowable on a separate return
for a spouse who has gross income in any amount within the mean-
ing of such section,

The Internal Revenue Service has reccived inquiries relative to
whether an individual may claim his spouse as a dependent on his
separate Federal income tax return under the provisions of section
151 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. The inquiries indicate
that the writers thereof interpret the above section of the Code to
mean that a taxpayer is allowed a deduction of $600 for his wife as
an exemption and an additional deduction of $600 for her as a de-
pendent and further that the taxpayer may claim his wife as a de-
pendent even though she has income of her own and files a separate
return.

Section 151 (b) of the Code provides, in part, as follows:

* * * An exemption of §600 for the taxpayer; and an additional exemp
      tion of $600 for the spouse of the taxpayer if a separate return is made by the
      taxpayer, and if the spouse, for the calendar year in which the taxable year
      of the taxpayer begins, has no gross income and is not the dependent of another
      taxpayer,

Under the provisions of section 25(b) (1) (A) of the Internal Rev-
enue Code of 1939, which are substantially the same as section 151(b)
of the Code of 1954, an exemption was not allowable on a separate re-
turn for the spouse of the taxpayer if the spouse had gross income of
any amount or was the dependent of another taxpayer.

he Report of the Committee on Finance, Daited States Senate,
No. 1622, Eighty-third Congress, on H. BR. 8300 (Internal Revenue
Yode of 1954), 192, states with respect to section 151 of the Code in
part as follows:

Subsection (b) corresponds to section 25(b) (1) (A) of the 1939 Code; * * *
No substantive changes are made in these provisions.

Section 152 of the 1954 Code defines a “dependent” and adds to the
list of individuals eligible as dependents any individual who is a mem-
ber of the taxpayer’s household and whose principal abode for the
taxable year of the taxpayer is the home of the taxpayer. That sec-

19 [§ 152,

tion has as its purpose the inclusion of certain persons for whom no
exemption was allowed under prior law but does not have the effect
of expanding the definition of dependent to include the taxpayer's
spouse. Spouses are specifically dealt with in a separate subsection
of section 151 of the Code.

Accordingly, it is held that since section 151 of the 1954 Code does
not eifect a change with respect to the allowance of an exemption for
the spouse of a taxpayer provided in section 25(b) (1) (A) of the 1939
Code, for the purpose of such sections, a taxpayer's spouse cannot
qualify as his dependent and an exemption is not allowable on a
separate return for a sponse who has gross income in any amount.
However, a taxpayer who files a separate return may obtain a deduc-
tion for the personal exemption of his wife, as well a3 a deduction for
himself, provided his wife has no gross income and is not the dependent
of another taxpayer.

SECTION 152.—DEPENDENT DEFINED
Rev. Rul. 55 806

The application of the provisions of section 152(¢) of the Lntergal
Revenve Code of 1954, in determining the allowance of a dependeucy
exemption in cases of multiple support.

The application of the provisions of section 152(¢) of the Internal
Revenue bode of 1954, relating to multiple support agreements is il-
lustrated by the following examples:

Example (1). Four brothers together contributed the entire sup-
port of their mother in 1954 in the following percentages: A, 30 per-
cent; B, 20 percent; 7, 29 percent; and D, 21 percent.

Example (2). An individual, #, who resides with his son received
his entire support of $1,500 for the year 1954 in the following per-
centages: Social Security, 25 percent; #, an unrelated neighbor, 11
percent; @, a brother, 14 percent; #, a daughter, 10 percent; and J, a
son, 40 percent.

Seetion 152 of the Code provides in part as follows:

{a) Genera, Derinitron,— * * * the term “dependent” means any of the
following individuals over half of whose support, for the calendar year in which
the taxable year of the tazpayer begins, was received from the taxpayer (or is
treated under subsection (¢c) as received from the taxpayer):

LJ ® * * * * .

{e) Muiteite Support AcREEMeENTS.—For purposes of subsection (a), over
half of the support of an individual for a calendar year shall be treated as re-
eeived from the taxpayer if—

(1) no one person contributed over half of such support;

(2) over balf of such support was received from persons each of whom,
but for the fact that he did net contribute over balf of such snpport, would
have heen entitled to claim such individual as a dependent for a (axable year
beginning in such calendar year;

(3) the taxpayer contributed over 10 percent of such support; anid

(4) each person described in paragraph (2) (other than ihe taxpayer)
who contributed over 10 percent of such support files a written declaration
(in such manuer and form as the Secretary or his delegate may by regula-
tions prescribe) that he will not claim such individual as a dependent for
any taxable ycar beginning in such calendar year.

In example (1) above any one of the brothers, except for the fact
that he did not contribute more than half of his mother’s support,

4152.) 20

would have been entitled to claim her as a dependent. Consequently,
any one of the brothers could claim a deduction for the exemption of
tha mother provided a written declaration from each of the other
brothers is attached to his Federal income tax return. Even though
A and 2 together contributed more than one-half the support of their
mother, if A wished to claim his mother as a dependent, he would be
required to attach written declarations from B and @ as well as from
D to his income tax return, since each of those three contributed more
than 10 percent of the total support of their mother.

In example (2) above G, H, and J are persons each of whom, except
for the fact that neither contributed more than half of the $1,500, could
claim # as a dependent for a taxable year beginning in 1954, The
three together contributed 64 percent of the $1,500, and, thus, each is
a member of the group to be considered for the purpose of section
152(c) of the Code. Gand Z are the only members of such group who
can meet all the requirements of section 152(c) of the Code and either
one could claim # as a dependent for his taxable year beginning in
1954 provided he attached to his income tax return a written declara-
tion signed by the other, and furnished the other information required
by the return with respect to all the contributions to Z. Inasmuch as
Z did not contribute more than 10 percent of A’s support, she would
not be entitled to claim Z as a dependent for a taxable year beginning
in 1954 nor would she be required to file a written declaration with
respect to her contributions to #. # contributed over 10 percent of
the support of # in 1954 but he does not otherwise qualify as a member
of the group for the purpose of the multiple support agreement under
section 152(c) of the Colle.

The member of a group of contributors who claims the dependency
deduction for an individual under the multiple support agreement
provisions of section 152(c) of the Code must attach to his income
tax return for the year of the deduction a written declaration from
each of the other persons who contributed more than 10 percent of
the support of andl individual and who, but for the failure to con-
tribute more than half of the support of the individual, would have
been cntitled to claim the dependency exemption. The written dec-
Jaration required may be made on Form 2120, Multiple Support
Agreement, which contains a statement of the fact of contribution
and a waiver of the claim for dependency exemption. Copies of
Form 2120 will be supplied by Distriet Directors to persons who re-
quest such forms, Any declaration made other than on Form 2120
shall conform to the substance of Form 2120. The taxpayer claiming
the exemption should be prepared to furnish other information, when
required, which will substantiate his right to claim such exemption.
Such information may include a statement showing the names of all
contributors (whether members of the group described in section
152(c) of the Code or not) and the amount contributed by each to the
RUB EE of the dependent claimed.

This ruling will be applicable only for the period prior to the
promulgation of regulations prescribed by the Commissioner, with
the approval of the Secretary, in which will be set forth rules with
respect. to section 152{¢) of the Code.

United States Naval Academy, the United States Air Force Academy
or the United States Coast Guard Academy dees not constitute a
scholarship award within the meaning of section 152(d) (2) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1954, In the absence of evidence #s-
tublishing thit a taxpayer furnished more than half of the sup-
port of a cadet or midshipman and that the other requirements of
section 151(a) of the Code are met, an Cxewmplion fur a dependent

‘The taxpayer's son in the instant case ig a cadet in the United States
Militury Academy. He receives monthly pay and allowances, and
pays for his meals, uniforms, text books, ete. Taxes are withheld
at the source from his wages. During vacations and holidays the son
resides with the taxpayer.

Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 provides in part
as follows:

(a) Spectat Suerort Test rv Case or Stupeyxrs.—For purposes of subsection
(a), in the case of any individual who is—~

(2) a student (within the meaning of section 151(e) (4)}, amounts re
ceived as scholarships for study at an educational inslilulion (as defined
in section 151(e) (4)) shalt not be taken into account in determining whether
such individual reccived more than half of his support from the taxpayer.

A scholarship is generally considered as an allowance to a student
at an educational institution to aid him in pursuing his studies. Such
a student does not reccive wages nor is he usually obligated to perform
any services for the institution subsequeut to graduation. The op-
posite is true with respect to a cadet in the Military Academy. He is
considered as being in the “Regular Army” and receives pay and
allowances for the performance of services as a cadet, from which
income tax is withheld. The Army Organization Act of 1950, 64
Stat. 263, at 268, 10 U.S. ©. 1e(b). An obligation exists on the part
of a cadet by reason of the articles of agreement signed by him upon
entrance into the Academy to complete the course of training and to
aecept a commission in the Regular Army upon graduation, Act of

The rules governing the appointment of cadets, including the pay
and allowances, apply equally to midshipmen at the United States
Naval Academy, cadets at the United States Coast Guard Academy
and cadets at the United States Air Force Academy. See Career
Compensation Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 802, at 828, as amended 37 U.S. C.

Accordingly, it is held that an appointment to the United States
Military Academy, the United States Naval Academy, the United
States “Air Force Academy, or the [United States Coast Guard
Academy does not constitute a scholarship award within the meaning

,of section 152(d) (2) of the Code. Therefore, in the absence of evi-
