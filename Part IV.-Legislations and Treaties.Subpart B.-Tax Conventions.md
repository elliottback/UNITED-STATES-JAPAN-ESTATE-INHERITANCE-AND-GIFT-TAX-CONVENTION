        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The application of the provisions of paragraph (1) of this Article shall be limited to the particular property, and any portion thereof, which without such provisions would be subjected to the taxes of both contracting States or would be so subjected except for a specific exemption.</li>
</ol>

##  ARTICLE IV

Where one of the contracting States imposes the tax solely by reason of the situs of property within such State, in the case of a decedent who at the time of his death, or of a donor who at the time of the gift, was a national of or domiciled in the United States, or in the case of a beneficiary of a decedent's estate who at the time of such decedent's death, or a beneficiary of a gift who at the time of the gift, was domiciled in Japan, the contracting State so imposing the tax:

<ol type="a">
    <li>shall allow a specific exemption which would be applicable under its laws if the decedent, donor, or beneficiary, as the case may be, had been a national of or domiciled in such State, in an amount not less than the proportion thereof which (A) the value of the property, situated according to Article III in such State and subjected to the taxes of both contracting States or which would be so subjected except for a specific exemption, bears to (B) the value of the total property which would be subjected to the tax of such State if such decedent, donor, or beneficiary had been a national of or domiciled in such State; and</li>
    <li>shall (except for the purpose of subparagraph (a) of this paragraph and for the purpose of any other proportional allowance otherwise provided) take no account of property situated according to Article III outside such State in determining the amount of the tax.</li>
</ol>

## ARTICLE V

<ol>
    <li>Where either contracting State imposes the tax by reason of the nationality thereof or the domicile therein of a decedent or a donor or a beneficiary of a decedent's estate or of a gift, such State shall allow against its tax (computed without application of this Article) a credit for the tax imposed by the other contracting State with respect to property situated at the time of the transfer in such other State and included for the taxes of both States (but the amount of the credit shall not exceed that portion of the tax imposed by the crediting State which is attributable to such property). The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply with respect to any property referred to in paragraph (2) of this Article.</li>
    <li>Where each contracting State imposes the tax by reasons of the nationality
thereof or the domicile therein of a decedent or a donor or a beneficiary, with
respect to any property situated at the time of the transfer outside both contracting
States (or deemed by each contracting State to be situated in its territory,
or deemed by one contracting State to be situated in either contracting
State and deemed by the other contracting State to be situated outside both
contracting States or deemed by each contracting State to be situated in the
other contracting State), each contracting State shall allow against its tax
(computed without application of this Article) a credit for a part of the tax
imposed by the other contracting State attributable to such property. The total
of the credits authorized by this paragraph shall be equal to the amount of
the tax imposed with respect to such property by the contracting State imposing
the smaller amount of the tax with respect to such property, and shall be
divided between both contracting States in proportion to the amount of the tax
imposed by each contracting State with respect to such property.</li>
    <li>The credit authorized by this Article, if applicable, shall be in lieu of any
credit for the same tax authorized by the laws of the crediting State, the credit
applicable for the particular tax being either credit authorized by this Article
or credit authorized by such laws, whichever is the greater. For the purposes of
this Article, the amount of the tax of each contracting State attributable to
any designated property shall be ascertained after taking into account any applicable
diminution or credit against its tax with respect to such property (other
than any credit under paragraph (1) or (2) of this Article), provided, however,
in case another credit for the tax of any other foreign State is allowable with
respect to the same property pursuant to any other convention between the crediting
State under the present convention and such other foreign State, or pursuant
to the laws of the crediting State, the total of such credits shall not exceed the
amount of tax of the crediting State attributable to such property computed before
allowance of such credits.</li>
    <li>Credit against the tax of one of the contracting States for the tax of the
other contracting State shall be allowed under this Article only where both
such taxes have been simultaneously imposed at the time of a decedent's death
or at the time of a gift.</li>
    <li> No credit resulting from the application of this Article shall be allowed
after more than five years from the due date of the tax against which credit
would otherwise be allowed, unless claim therefore was filed within such five year
period. Any refund resulting from tbe application of this Article shall
be made without payment of interest on the amount so refunded, unless otherwise
specifically authorized by the crediting State.</li>
    <li>Credit against the tax of one of the contracting States shall not be finally
allowed for the tax of the other contracting State until the latter tax (reduced
by credit authorized under this Article, if any) has been paid.</li>
</ol>

## ARTICLE VI

<ol>
    <li>The competent authorities of both contracting States shall exchange such
information available under the respective tax laws of both contracting States
as is necessary for carrying out the provisions of the present convention or for
the prevention of fraud or for the administration of statutory provisions against
tax avoidance in relation to the tax. Any information so exchanged shall be
treated as secret and shall not be disclosed to any person other than those,
including a court, concerned with the assessment and collection of the tax or the
determination of appeals in relation thereto. No information shall be exchanged
which would disclose any trade, business, industrial or professional secret or any
trade process.</li>
    <li>Each of the contracting States may collect the tax imposed by the other
contracting State (as though such tax were the tax of the former State) as will
ensure that the credit or any other benefit granted under the present convention
by such other State shall not be enjoyed by persons not entitled to such benefits.</li>
</ol>

## ARTICLE VII

Where a representative of the estate of a decedent or a beneficiary of such
estate or a donor or a beneficiary of a gift shows proof that the action of the tax
authorities of either contracting State has resulted, or will result, in double
taxation contrary to the provisions of the present convention, such representative,
donor or beneficiary shall be entitled to present the facts to the competent
authorities of the contracting State of which the decedent was a national at the
time of his death or of which the donor or beneficiary is a national, or if the
decedent was not a national of either of the contracting States at the time of
his death or if the donor or the beneficiary is not a national of either of the
contracting States, to tbe competent authorities of the contracting State in
which the decedent was domiciled or resident at the time of his death or in which
the donor or beneficiary is domiciled or resident. Should the claim be deemed
worthy of consideration, the competent authorities of such State to which the
facts are so presented shall undertake to come to an agreement with the competent
authorities of the other contracting State with a view to equitable
avoidance of the double taxation in question.

## ARTICLE VIII

<ol>
    <li>The provisions of the present convention shall not be construed to deny
or affect in any manner the right of diplomatic and consular officers to other or
additional exemptions now enjoyed or which may hereafter be granted to such
officers.</li>
    <li>The provisions of the present convention shall not be construed so as to
increase the tax imposed by either contracting State.</li>
    <li>Should any difficulty or doubt arise as to the interpretation or application
of the present convention, or its relationship to conventions between one of
the contracting States and any other State, the competent authorities of the
contracting States may settle the question by mutual agreement; it being understood,
however, that this provision shall not be construed to preclude the contracting 
States from settling by negotiation any dispute arising under the present convention.</li>
    <li>The competent authorities of both contracting States may prescribe regulations
necessary to interpret and carry out the provisions of the present convention
and may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of giving
effect to the provisions of the present convention.</li>
</ol>

## ARTICLE IX

<ol>
    <li>The present convention shall be ratified and the instruments of ratification
shall be exchanged at Tokyo as soon as possible.</li>
    <li>The present convention shall enter into force on the date of exchange of
instruments of ratification and shall be applicable to estates or inheritances in
the case of persons who die on or after the date of such exchange and to gifts
made on or after that date.</li>
    <li>Either of the contracting States may terminate the present convention
at any time after a period of five years shall have expired from the date on which
the convention enters into force, by giving to the other contracting State notice
of termination, provided that such notice is given on or before the 90th day of
June and, in such event, the present convention shall cease to be effective for
the taxable years beginning on or after the first day of January of the calendar
year next following that in which such notice is given.</li>
