# SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT

---

The publication of Revenue Ruling 54-501 in Cumulative Bulletin 1954-2, beginning on page 197, failed to reflect one of the two corrections announced on page 6 of Internal Revenue Bulletin 1954-48, dated November 29, 1954. Accordingly, that correction is repeated in this publication to call particular attention to the error and to suggest that a pen and ink or pencilled notation be made on page 205 of Cumulative Bulletin 1954-2, us follows:

The words, “the principal of the Old Bonds but not in excess of” should be added after the words, “is in excess of” on the seventh line of the first paragraph beginning on page 205.

As so corrected, the paragraph should read as follows:

> The gain or loss realized upon the exchange of the Old Bonds, including those
> acquired subsequent to 10 December 11, 1941, will represent capital gain or capital
> loss under the provisions of section 117 of the Code. However, in cases where
> the Old Bonds were acquired prior to December 11, 1941, interest income will be
> realized to the extent that the fair market value of the assets received in the
> exchange is in excess of the principal of the Old Bonds but not in excess of such
> principal and the interest accrued and unpaid on the Old Bonds since the date
> of the recovery. In cases where Old Bonds were acquired subsequent te December
> 11, 1941, interest income will be realized to the extent that the fair market
> value of the assets received in the exchange is in excess of the principal of the
> Old Bonds bul not in excess of such principal and the interest accrued and unpaid
> on such bonds since the date of their acquisition.
