# THE TAX COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

---

## CUMULATIVE LIST OF ANNOUNCEMENTS RELATING TO DECISIONS OF THE TAX COURT OF THE UNITED STATES PUBLISHED IN THE INTERNAL REVENUE BULLETIN FROM JANUARY 1, 1955, TO JUNE 30, 1955, INCLUSIVE

---

It is the policy of the Internal Revenue Service to announce in the
Internal Revenue Bulletin at the earliest practicable date the determination 
of the Commissioner to acquiesce or not to acquiesce in a
decision of The Tax Court of the United States which disallows a
deficiency in tax determined by the Commissioner to be due. Notice
that the Commissioner had acquiesced or nonacquiesced in a decision
of The Tax Court relates only to the issue or issues decided adversely
to the Government. Actions of acquiescences in adverse decisions
should be relied on by Revenue officers and others concerned as conclusions 
of the Service only as to the application of the law to the
facts in the particular case. Caution should be exercised in extending
the application of the decision to similar cases unless the facts and circumstances 
are substantially the same, and consideration should be
given to the effect of new legislation, regulations, and rulings as well
as subsequent court decisions and actions thereon. Acquiescence in a
decision means acceptance by the Service of the conclusion reached
and does not necessarily mean acceptance and approval of any or all
of the reasons assigned by the Court for its conclusions. No announcements 
are made in the Bulletin with respect to memorandum opinions
of The Tax Court.

The Commissioner ACQUIESCES in the following decisions:
